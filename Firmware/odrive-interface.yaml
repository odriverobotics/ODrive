        brief: Voltage on the DC bus as measured by the ODrive.
      ibus:

        unit: A
        brief: Current on the DC bus as calculated by the ODrive.
        doc: |
          A positive value means that the ODrive is consuming power from the power supply,
          a negative value means that the ODrive is sourcing power to the power supply.

          This value is equal to the sum of the motor currents and the brake resistor currents.
          The motor currents are measured, the brake resistor current is calculated based on
          `config.brake_resistance`.

              This protects against cases in which the power supply fails to dissipate
              the brake power if the brake resistor is disabled.
              The default is 26V for the 24V board version and 52V for the 48V board version.

          enable_dc_bus_overvoltage_ramp:

            status: experimental
            brief: Enables the DC bus overvoltage ramp feature.
            doc: |
              If enabled, if the measured DC voltage exceeds `dc_bus_overvoltage_ramp_start`,
              the ODrive will sink more power than usual into the the brake resistor
              in an attempt to bring the voltage down again.
              
              The brake duty cycle is increased by the following amount:

               * `vbus_voltage` == `dc_bus_overvoltage_ramp_start`  =>  brake_duty_cycle += 0%
               * `vbus_voltage` == `dc_bus_overvoltage_ramp_end`  =>  brake_duty_cycle += 100%
              
              Remarks:
               - This feature is active even when all motors are disarmed.
               - This feature is disabled if `brake_resistance` is non-positive.

            status: experimental
            brief: See `enable_dc_bus_overvoltage_ramp`.
            doc: Must be larger than `dc_bus_overvoltage_ramp_start`,

            doc: |
              You tried to run a state before you are allowed to. Typically you
              tried to run encoder calibration or closed loop control before the
              motor was calibrated, or you tried to run closed loop control
              before the encoder was calibrated.
          DcBusUnderVoltage:
            brief: The DC voltage fell below the limit configured in `config.dc_bus_undervoltage_trip_level`.
            doc: |
              Confirm that your power leads are connected securely. For initial
              testing a 12V PSU which can supply a couple of amps should be
              sufficient while the use of low current ‘wall wart’ plug packs may
              lead to inconsistent behaviour and is not recommended.

              You can monitor your PSU voltage using liveplotter in odrivetool
              by entering `start_liveplotter(lambda: [odrv0.vbus_voltage])`. If
              you see your votlage drop below `config.dc_bus_undervoltage_trip_level`
              (default: ~ 8V) then you will trip this error. Even a relatively
              small motor can draw multiple kW momentary and so unless you have
              a very large PSU or are running of a battery you may encounter
              this error when executing high speed movements with a high current
              limit. To limit your PSU power draw you can limit your motor
              current and/or velocity limit `controller.config.vel_limit` and
              `motor.config.current_lim`.
          DcBusOverVoltage:
            brief: The DC voltage exceeded the limit configured in `config.dc_bus_overvoltage_trip_level`.
            doc: |
              Confirm that you have a brake resistor of the correct value
              connected securely and that `config.brake_resistance` is set to
              the value of your brake resistor.

              You can monitor your PSU voltage using liveplotter in odrivetool
              by entering `start_liveplotter(lambda: [odrv0.vbus_voltage])`. If
              during a move you see the voltage rise above your PSU’s nominal
              set voltage then you have your brake resistance set too low. This
              may happen if you are using long wires or small gauge wires to
              connect your brake resistor to your odrive which will added extra
              resistance. This extra resistance needs to be accounted for to
              prevent this voltage spike. If you have checked all your
              connections you can also try increasing your brake resistance by
              ~ 0.01 Ohm at a time to a maximum of 0.05 greater than your brake
              resistor value.

            brief: The measured motor phase resistance is outside of the plausible range.
            doc: |
              During calibration the motor resistance and
              [inductance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductance) is measured.
              If the measured motor resistance or inductance falls outside a set
              range this error will be returned. Check that all motor leads are
              connected securely.

              The measured values can be viewed using odrivetool as is shown below:
              ```
              In [2]: odrv0.axis0.motor.config.phase_inductance
              Out[2]: 1.408751450071577e-05

              Out[3]: 0.029788672924041748
              ```
              Some motors will have a considerably different phase resistance
              and inductance than this. For example, gimbal motors, some small
              motors (e.g. < 10A peak current). If you think this applies to you
              try increasing `config.resistance_calib_max_voltage` from
              its default value of 1 using odrivetool and repeat the motor
              calibration process. If your motor has a small peak current draw
              (e.g. < 20A) you can also try decreasing
              `config.calibration_current` from its default value of 10A.

              In general, you need
              ```text
              resistance_calib_max_voltage > calibration_current * phase_resistance
              resistance_calib_max_voltage < 0.5 * vbus_voltage
              ```

          DrvFault:
            brief: The gate driver chip reported an error.
            doc: |
              The ODrive v3.4 is known to have a hardware issue whereby the
              motors would stop operating when applying high currents to M0. The
              reported error of both motors in this case is `ERROR_DRV_FAULT`.

              The conjecture is that the high switching current creates large
              ripples in the power supply of the DRV8301 gate driver chips, thus
              tripping its under-voltage fault detection.

              To resolve this issue you can limit the M0 current to 40A. The
              lowest current at which the DRV fault was observed is 45A on one
              test motor and 50A on another test motor. Refer to
              [this post](https://discourse.odriverobotics.com/t/drv-fault-on-odrive-v3-4/558)
              for instructions for a hardware fix.

              The bus voltage was insufficent to push the requested current

              For gimbal motors, it is recommended to set the

              to half your bus voltage, or less.

      FullCalibrationSequence:
        doc: Run motor calibration and then encoder offset calibration (or encoder
          index search if `<axis>.encoder.config.use_index` is `True`).
      MotorCalibration:
        brief: Measure phase resistance and phase inductance of the motor.
        doc: |
           * To store the results set `motor.config.pre_calibrated` to `True`
           and save the configuration (`save_configuration()`). After that you
           don't have to run the motor calibration on the next start up.
           * This modifies the variables `motor.config.phase_resistance` and
           `motor.config.phase_inductance`.
      SensorlessControl:
        brief: Run sensorless control.
        doc: |
           * The motor must be calibrated (`motor.is_calibrated`)
           * `controller.config.control_mode` must be `True`.
      EncoderIndexSearch:
        brief: Turn the motor in one direction until the encoder index is traversed.
        doc: This state can only be entered if `encoder.config.use_index` is `True`.
      EncoderOffsetCalibration:
        brief: Turn the motor in one direction for a few seconds and then back to measure the offset between the encoder position and the electrical phase.
        doc: |
           * Can only be entered if the motor is calibrated (`motor.is_calibrated`).
           * A successful encoder calibration will make the `encoder.is_ready`
           go to true.
      ClosedLoopControl:
        brief: Run closed loop control.
        doc: |
           * The action depends on the `controller.config.control_mode`.
           * Can only be entered if the motor is calibrated
           (`motor.is_calibrated`) and the encoder is ready (`encoder.is_ready`).
      LockinSpin:
        brief: Run lockin spin.
        doc: |
          Can only be entered if the motor is calibrated (`motor.is_calibrated`)
