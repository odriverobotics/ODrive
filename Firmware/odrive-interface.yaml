      toplevel interface.

        flags:
          CONTROL_ITERATION_MISSED:
            brief: At least one control iteration was missed.
            doc: |
              The main control loop is supposed to runs at a fixed frequency.
              If the device is computationally overloaded (e.g. too many active
              components) it's possible that one or more control iterations
              are skipped.
          DC_BUS_UNDER_VOLTAGE:
            brief: The DC voltage fell below the limit configured in `config.dc_bus_undervoltage_trip_level`.
            doc: |
              Confirm that your power leads are connected securely. For initial
              testing a 12V PSU which can supply a couple of amps should be
              sufficient while the use of low current ‘wall wart’ plug packs may
              lead to inconsistent behaviour and is not recommended.

              You can monitor your PSU voltage using liveplotter in odrivetool
              by entering `start_liveplotter(lambda: [odrv0.vbus_voltage])`. If
              you see your votlage drop below `config.dc_bus_undervoltage_trip_level`
              (default: ~ 8V) then you will trip this error. Even a relatively
              small motor can draw multiple kW momentary and so unless you have
              a very large PSU or are running of a battery you may encounter
              this error when executing high speed movements with a high current
              limit. To limit your PSU power draw you can limit your motor
              current and/or velocity limit `Axis:controller.config.vel_limit` and
              `Axis:motor.config.current_lim`.
          DC_BUS_OVER_VOLTAGE:
            brief: The DC voltage exceeded the limit configured in `config.dc_bus_overvoltage_trip_level`.
            doc: |
              Confirm that you have a brake resistor of the correct value
              connected securely and that `config.brake_resistance` is set to
              the value of your brake resistor.

              You can monitor your PSU voltage using liveplotter in odrivetool
              by entering `start_liveplotter(lambda: [odrv0.vbus_voltage])`. If
              during a move you see the voltage rise above your PSU’s nominal
              set voltage then you have your brake resistance set too low. This
              may happen if you are using long wires or small gauge wires to
              connect your brake resistor to your odrive which will added extra
              resistance. This extra resistance needs to be accounted for to
              prevent this voltage spike. If you have checked all your
              connections you can also try increasing your brake resistance by
              ~ 0.01 Ohm at a time to a maximum of 0.05 greater than your brake
              resistor value.
          DC_BUS_OVER_REGEN_CURRENT:
            doc: |
              Current flowing back into the power supply exceeded `config.dc_max_negative_current`.
              This can happen if your brake resistor is disabled or unable to handle the braking current.
              
              Check that `config.enable_brake_resistor` is `True` and that
              `(V_power_supply / Brake_resistance) > (total motor.config.current_lim + total motor.config.current_lim_margin)`.
          DC_BUS_OVER_CURRENT:
            doc: |
              Too much current was pulled from the power supply. `ibus` exceeded `config.dc_max_positive_current`.

          A positive value means that the ODrive is consuming power from the power supply,
          a negative value means that the ODrive is sourcing power to the power supply.

          This value is equal to the sum of the motor currents and the brake resistor currents.
          The motor currents are measured, the brake resistor current is calculated based on

          If this property is true, something is bad in the configuration. The
          ODrive can still be used in this state but the user should investigate
          which setting is problematic. This variable does not cover all
          misconfigurations.

          Possible causes:
           - A GPIO was set to a mode that it doesn't support
           - A GPIO was set to a mode for which the corresponding feature was
             not enabled. Example: `GPIO_MODE_UART_A` was used without enabling
             `config.enable_uart_a`.
           - A feature was enabled which is not supported on this hardware.
             Example: `config.enable_uart_c` set to true on ODrive v3.x.
           - A GPIO was used as an interrupt input for two internal components
             or two GPIOs that are mutually exclusive in their interrupt
             capability were both used as interrupt input.
             Example: `Axis:config.step_gpio_pin` of both axes were set to the same GPIO.

          The protocol that's being run on the device's virtual COM port on

          Note that the ODrive has two independent interfaces on USB: One
          is the virtual COM port (affected by this option) and the other
          one is a vendor specific interface which always runs Fibre.
          So changing this option does not affect the working of odrivetool.

        doc: |
          If you set this to a lower value than the true brake resistance
          then the ODrive will not meed the `max_regen_current` constraint
          during braking, that is it will sink more than `max_regen_current`
          into the power supply. Some power supplies don't like this.

          If you set this to a higher value than the true brake resistance
          then the ODrive will unnecessarily burn more power than required
          during braking.

        doc: |
          If enabled, if the measured DC voltage exceeds `dc_bus_overvoltage_ramp_start`,
          the ODrive will sink more power than usual into the the brake resistor
          in an attempt to bring the voltage down again.
          
          The brake duty cycle is increased by the following amount:

           * `ODrive:vbus_voltage` == `dc_bus_overvoltage_ramp_start`  =>  brake_duty_cycle += 0%
           * `ODrive:vbus_voltage` == `dc_bus_overvoltage_ramp_end`  =>  brake_duty_cycle += 100%
          
          Remarks:
           - This feature is active even when all motors are disarmed.
           - This feature is disabled if `brake_resistance` is non-positive.

          PHASE_RESISTANCE_OUT_OF_RANGE:
            brief: The measured motor phase resistance is outside of the plausible range.
            doc: |
              During calibration the motor resistance and
              [inductance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductance) is measured.
              If the measured motor resistance or inductance falls outside a set
              range this error will be returned. Check that all motor leads are
              connected securely.

              The measured values can be viewed using odrivetool as is shown below:
              ```
              In [2]: odrv0.axis0.motor.config.phase_inductance
              Out[2]: 1.408751450071577e-05

              In [3]: odrv0.axis0.motor.config.phase_resistance
              Out[3]: 0.029788672924041748
              ```
              Some motors will have a considerably different phase resistance
              and inductance than this. For example, gimbal motors, some small
              motors (e.g. < 10A peak current). If you think this applies to you
              try increasing `config.resistance_calib_max_voltage` from
              its default value of 1 using odrivetool and repeat the motor
              calibration process. If your motor has a small peak current draw
              (e.g. < 20A) you can also try decreasing
              `config.calibration_current` from its default value of 10A.

              In general, you need
              ```text
              resistance_calib_max_voltage > calibration_current * phase_resistance
              resistance_calib_max_voltage < 0.5 * vbus_voltage
              ```

              See `PHASE_RESISTANCE_OUT_OF_RANGE` for details.
          DRV_FAULT:
            bit: 3
            brief: The gate driver chip reported an error.
            doc: |
              The ODrive v3.4 is known to have a hardware issue whereby the
              motors would stop operating when applying high currents to M0. The
              reported error of both motors in this case is `ERROR_DRV_FAULT`.

              The conjecture is that the high switching current creates large
              ripples in the power supply of the DRV8301 gate driver chips, thus
              tripping its under-voltage fault detection.

              To resolve this issue you can limit the M0 current to 40A. The
              lowest current at which the DRV fault was observed is 45A on one
              test motor and 50A on another test motor. Refer to
              [this post](https://discourse.odriverobotics.com/t/drv-fault-on-odrive-v3-4/558)

              The bus voltage was insufficent to push the requested current
              through the motor.
              If you are getting this during motor calibration, make sure that
              `config.resistance_calib_max_voltage` is no more than half
              your bus voltage.

              For gimbal motors, it is recommended to set the
              `config.calibration_current` and `config.current_lim`
              to half your bus voltage, or less.
          CURRENT_SENSE_SATURATION:

            doc: |
              The current sense circuit saturated the current sense amplifier.
              This can be caused by setting `config.current_lim` higher than
              `config.requested_current_range`. If this happens, increase the
              requested current range, save the configuration, and reboot the controller.
          CURRENT_LIMIT_VIOLATION:
            bit: 12
            doc: |
              The motor current exceeded `motor.config.current_lim + motor.config.current_lim_margin`.
              The current controller is a PI controller, so it can experience overshoot. The PI gains
              are automatically calculated based on `config.current_control_bandwidth` and the
              motor resistance and inductance (pole placement). Some overshoot is normal, so a sensible
              solution is to increase the current limit margin if your current limit is large.

              An attempt was made to run the motor PWM while the brake resistor was configured as enabled
              (`config.enable_brake_resistor`) but disarmed.

              The most common cause is that you just set `config.enable_brake_resistor` to `True` but didn't
              arm the brake resistor yet (by either rebooting or running `odrvX.clear_errors()`).

              Otherwise, the brake resistor can be disarmed due to various system-wide errors.
              The root cause will usually show up under `system` when you run `dump_errors(odrvX)`.

              To re-arm the brake resistor reboot the ODrive or run `odrvX.clear_errors()`.

              In almost all scenarios, the currents on phase A, B and C should
              add up to zero. A small amount of measurement noise is expected.
              However if the sum of A, B, C currents exceeds this configuration
              value, the motor gets disarmed immediately.

              Note that this feature is only works on devices with three current
              sensors (e.g. ODrive v4).

            doc: |
              Try increasing `config.vel_limit`. The default of 2 turns per second 
              gives a motor speed of only 120 RPM. Note: Even if
              you do not command your motor to exceed `config.vel_limit`,
              sudden changes in the load placed on a motor may cause this speed
              to be temporarily exceeded, resulting in this error.

              You can also try increasing `config.vel_limit_tolerance`. The
              default value of 1.2 means it will only allow a 20% violation of
              the speed limit. You can set `config.enable_overspeed_error` to False

              give desired behavior. For example, in position *control mode*, the position filter *input mode* will
              smooth out `input_pos` commands to give smoother motion.

              [your encoder](https://docs.odriverobotics.com/encoders). The
              ODrive uses your supplied value for the motor pole pairs to
              measure the CPR. So you should also double check this value.
              
              If you are still having issues, you can try to increase
              `config.calib_scan_distance` up to a factor of 4 above the default.

              If your encoder cpr and motor pole pair settings are correct,
              this error can be caused because motor cogging makes the motor
              move less or more than commanded. You can fix this by increasing
              `config.calib_scan_distance`.

              Note that the AMT encoders are configurable using the micro-
              switches on the encoder PCB and so you may need to check that
              these are in the right positions. If your encoder lists its pulse
              per rotation (PPR) multiply that number by four to get CPR.
